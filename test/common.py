    """Inspired by 3.11 TaskGroup.

    The main functionality here is to spawn processes, interact with them and
    make sure all of them have finished before stopping.

    In many cases, it is better to define processes that are executed using
    Sequence or Parallel.

    The semantics of providing sequence or parallel as methods here needs a bit of thought.
    - It may not be necessary as Parallel and Sequence can be used directly, and they already
      wait for the processes to finish.
    - It may be useful for spawning groups of processes that should run in the background,
      and then wait for all of them to finish.

    This is in the test/examples code as I have not thought about the semantics and the idea yet.
    I'm just using it for test-code at the moment.
