  - Breaking changes in the API: Examples triggered deprecation
    warnings from asyncio. Some of this was related to using
    `get_event_loop`.  This has been changed to get_running_loop(),
    but this does not start a new loop of a loop is not already
    running. Therefore, some of the examples had to be modified.
    Furthermore, run_CSP was removed. The recommended way to run 
    CSP processes is inside async functions and methods.
  - The net library was updated to work with newer Python versions.
  - aPyCSP channels were changed to use a single queue in the 
    implementation. This simplifies some of the implementation and 
    verification of correctness.
